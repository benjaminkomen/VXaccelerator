# VXaccelerator
This is an Android app to measure vertical accelerations. It is a modified version of an existing acceleration measuring app and was made by <a href="http://www.citg.tudelft.nl/index.php?id=19414">Dr.ir. C.B.M. Blom</a> from the Delft University of Technology, used with permission. It's main features are:
*Measure only vertical accelerations
*Record (write to text file) the accelerations
*Save and load the accelerations
*Perform a Fast Fourier Transform on the accelerations
